Personal Portfolio Web App


My portfolio combines React , Next.js , TypeScript  and Spring Boot to deliver a seamless and engaging user experience. It features a dynamic 3D Google Maps visualization that rotates around my school, Simon Fraser University, a Discord status card displaying my real-time activity, a Spotify integration showing what I am currently listening to, and an AI chatbot to answer queries about my skills, projects, and experiences.

Deployed the frontend on Vercel and the backend on Render, ensuring secure CORS configurations for seamless API interaction.

Enhanced user experience with Lottie animations, responsive UI using Tailwind CSS, and modular React components for maintainability and scalability.
